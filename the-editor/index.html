                <div class="kg-card-markdown"><p>In today's technological age, where harldy anything can be considered safe, it has become far easier to break into someone’s personal zone. By personal, we do<br>
not just mean the social media. The world wide web which has become the hub of storing and restoring information, considered to be<br>
the safest vault, is a mere toy in the hands of a few computer geniuses. Hackers, Black Hat Hackers, villains, crackers,<br>
cyber-criminals, cyber pirates as they are well-known, throw a malicious software or virus at a system to gain access to the<br>
desired information. Piqued by curiosity, they may perhaps break into your system too!</p>
<p><img src="http://wallpapercave.com/wp/mQJEaae.png" alt="hacking"></p>
<p>From once being the realm of curious teenagers to becoming a mysterious entangle of the arena of government spies, professional<br>
thieves and soldiers of fortune, computer hacking has come a long way in the past four decades or so. To put it in the simplest way<br>
possible, <strong><em>hacking</em></strong> <em>is about understanding how things work, breaking them into smaller pieces, fixing their flaws, adjusting<br>
them in accordance to your needs or improving them and finally reassembling them back to their form</em> and the person engaged in it is<br>
called a <strong><em>hacker</em></strong>.</p>
<p>Here is a compilation of a few hackers (or the whiz kids) who put the world in awe with their dexterity.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>John Draper,</strong> <em>the original whistle blower.</em></p>
<p>A legendary figure within the computer programming world and the hacker and security community, John Draper is the king of what<br>
they called <strong><em>phone phreaking</em></strong> back in the 1970s.</p>
<p>While playing with a plastic whistle from a cereal box, Draper and a friend noticed that it sounded a lot like the tone of AT&amp;T's<br>
routing switches for phone calls! Out of that simple discovery came the infamous <strong><em>"blue boxes"</em></strong> which Draper designed and sold<br>
from his home; <strong>the boxes allowed you to make as many long distance calls as you liked, free of charge.</strong> <em>Without this odd innovation,<br>
who's to say that we wouldn'tbe paying $3.77 per minute for a call overseas?</em></p>
<p><img src="https://usercontent1.hubstatic.com/12012750_f520.jpg" alt="Draper"></p>
<p><em>Bob Gudgel, Jay Dee Pritchard, and John “Captain Crunch” Draper with a bluebox.</em></p>
<p>Draper went on to link up with Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak (who brought his friend Steve Jobs along), and he taught the two<br>
everything he knew about phone phreaking, which lead to the first business collaboration of Wozniak and Jobs. Draper served<br>
5 years probation once he was finally caught, but he sort of changed the world, don't you think?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Alan Turing,</strong> <em>the first hacker ever?</em></p>
<p>A pioneer in the development of theoretical computer science, providing a formalisation to the concepts of algorithm and<br>
computation with the Turing machine, which can be considered a model of a general purpose computer, Turing is widely<br>
considered to be the <strong><em>father of theoretical Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence</em></strong>. Turing believed<br>
there was a better way to archive vast databases of information without needing to employ hundreds of workers to sit and do<br>
the math all day, crafting quite an innovative idea in back in the 1930’s, devising the idea of modern computing before it even existed!</p>
<p><img src="https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/89/55/45/895545cb1bfe78c4f5b2f0540f70fd3d.jpg" alt="Alan Turing"></p>
<p><em>Statue of Alan Turing at the Bletchley Park Museum, poring over an Enigma machine.</em></p>
<p>During the Second World War, Turing worked for the Government Code and Cypher School (GC&amp;CS) at Bletchley Park, Britain's codebreaking<br>
centre that produced Ultra intelligence. For a time he led Hut 8, the section responsible for German naval cryptanalysis. He<br>
devised a number of techniques for speeding up the breaking of German ciphers, including improvements to the pre-war Polish bombe method,<br>
an electromechanical machine that could find settings for the Enigma machine. Turing developed quite an innovative machine,<br>
known as <em><strong>The Turing Machine</strong></em>, which was responsible for <em><strong>cracking the Nazi encryption system known as enigma, saving more<br>
British lives in World War 2 than any single person</strong></em>. Essentially <em><strong>Turing hacked the Nazi’s, winning Britain the war!</strong></em></p>
<p><img src="http://www.rutherfordjournal.org/images/TAHC_Bombe.jpg" alt="Enigma"></p>
<p><em><strong>The Bombe</strong> was an electromechanical device used by Turing (and later British cryptologists in general) to help decipher German Enigma-machine-encrypted secret messages.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>A person who uses computers to gain unauthorized access to data</strong></em> is Google's definition of a hacker. That's precisely<br>
what Turing did and by this definition, he could be classified as <strong><em>the very first hacker!</em></strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Gary Thuerk,</strong> <em>The Father Of Spam!</em></p>
<p>Gary Thuerk — a marketer working for Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC), an early computer manufacturer, <em><strong>invented spam.</strong></em> Yes, you<br>
read the right. On May 3rd 1978, 26 years ago this week, Thuerk composed an email marketing campaign promoting DEC’s newest<br>
computers and sent it to nearly 400 email users on ARPANET — at one time.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.adpushup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/First_spam_email2.jpg" alt="spam"></p>
<p><em>The first ever spam mail.</em></p>
<p>Thuerk, however, prefers the term <em><strong>E-marketing</strong></em> to <em><strong>spam</strong></em> and claims there's a difference. While it's true<br>
that Thuerk's spam which was essentially a targeted e-mail sent to a specific mailing list, 600 users with a single click,<br>
isn't exactly the spam we know and hate today, he is still the one who had the brilliant idea. He was the first to see a<br>
huge opportunity in online marketing and grabbed it with both hands. A rather <em>unique</em> way to hack the world indeed!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Aaron Swartz,</strong> <em>Internet's Own Boy.</em></p>
<p>You will be incredibly inspired by the genius and the drive of Aaron Swartz, humbled by his inner moral code that never<br>
wavered, the courage he had to fight the established corporate machine, and saddened by the loss of a brilliant, gentle soul<br>
who had already had a profoundly positive impact on our lives, yet less than it should have been.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Once I realised there were real, serious problems, fundamental problems that I could do something to address, I didn't see a way to forget that.<br>
-Aaron Swartz.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Aaron Swartz – ‘The internets own boy’ was a computer programmer, entrepreneur, writer, political organizer and Internet  hacktivist.<br>
He either founded or was instrumental in Reddit, Creative Commons, the RSS Feed and so much more.</strong></em></p>
<p>Aaron was driven by a strong moral code of right and wrong and realized very early in his life that he could make a difference and that if he could, then he should.<br>
One of his defining features was his curiosity – more than just curiosity – his inner sense to always question and challenge everything.</p>
<p><img src="https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/ce/3e/fa/ce3efa026f0147ef0907cedc5c024afd.jpg" alt="Aaron Swartz"></p>
<p><strong><em>Aaron Swartz is a hacker that truly changed the world and helped sculpt the culture of the Internet as we know it today!</em></strong></p>
